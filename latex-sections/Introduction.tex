\section{Introduction}
Our project is to explore the application of machine learning algorithms in automatically detecting arrhythmia from ECG data. The goal is to create a model capable of distinguishing abnormal ECG signals from normal signals, enhancing the diagnosis and treatment of arrhythmia.

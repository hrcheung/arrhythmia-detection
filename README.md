## Introduction
Our project is to explore the application of machine learning algorithms in automatically detecting arrhythmia from ECG data. The goal is to create a model capable of distinguishing abnormal ECG signals from normal signals, enhancing the diagnosis and treatment of arrhythmia.

## How to Run Code
The feature engineering part is ready to run without loading local files. We have included wfdb API to retrieve data automatically.
The ”Train with Random Forest” part is ready to run on Colab.
The ”Trained with Pre-Trained BERT” part was rewrote and ran on local machine.

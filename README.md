## Introduction
Our project is to explore the application of machine learning algorithms in automatically detecting arrhythmia from ECG data. The goal is to create a model capable of distinguishing abnormal ECG signals from normal signals, enhancing the diagnosis and treatment of arrhythmia.

## How to Run Code
- The feature engineering part is ready to run without loading local files. We have included wfdb API to retrieve data automatically. Please run Part 1 in **Detection.ipynb** file
- The ”Train with Random Forest” part is ready to run on Colab.
- The ”Trained with Pre-Trained BERT” part was rewrote and ran on local machine. Fintuned checkpoint can be downloaded from here: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1YhOM_-dX2ge2E1eiD_2Vr00Uvc2CUbJr/view?usp=share_link
